Stockfish is an open source UCI chess engine, developed by Tord Romstad, Joona Kiiski and Marco Costalba and licensed under the GNU General Public License version 3. The current version 4 (as of August 20, 2013) is available as C++ source code, and also has precompiled versions for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux 32-bit/64-bit. It can use up to thirty-two CPU cores in multiprocessor systems. The maximum size of the transposition tables is eight gigabytes. Stockfish implements an advanced alpha-beta search and uses bitboards.

This project modifies Stockfish and plugs in a neural evaluation function and a companion trainer for purely academic purposes. I thank Andrey Kotlarski without whose BPN, this project would be a lot harder to implement.

TODO:
1. Convert the code and run it in Python
2. Write a blog about the experience
